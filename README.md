Endless Moments LLC - Intelligent Internal Audit and Compliance Management
Proposer: Jay Manwani jaimani1@gmail.com

Project Description: AuditWise AI is a platform designed to help organizations maintain transparency,
accountability, and compliance with internal audit guidelines. It centralizes the creation, storage, and tracking of
internal audit policies, and can integrate best-practice frameworks from external audit firms. By using machine
learning and NLP, AuditWise AI assists with summarizing complex guidelines, automatically flagging potential
compliance gaps, and suggesting remediation steps. This ensures companies stay aligned with evolving regulations,
industry standards, and corporate governance requirements.

Key Features:
Audit Rule Management:
A centralized repository for internal audit rules, company-specific policies, and regulatory guidelines.
Tools for administrators to create, update, and retire audit controls, ensuring the most current policies are always
in effect.
Version tracking and access controls to maintain a clear history of revisions.
Partner Integration with Audit Firms:
Secure APIs for integrating recommended best practices and checklists provided by external audit partners.
Automatic updates of rules and guidelines as firms release new standards or adjust existing policies.
Automated Compliance Tracking & Reporting:
Automated assessments that measure adherence to each rule, highlighting departments, processes, or transactions
that deviate from established controls.
Dashboards and reports for internal stakeholders (management, audit committees) that display the current state of
compliance, trends over time, and areas needing attention.
AI-Driven Insights & Guidance:

Summarization:
NLP models to condense lengthy audit guidelines into concise, understandable summaries for quick reference.
Risk Detection & Anomaly Identification:
Machine learning algorithms to detect unusual patterns in operational or financial data that may indicate
non-compliance, fraud, or overlooked risks.
Guided Remediation Steps:
Suggestive features that recommend corrective actions based on historical resolutions, best practices, and patterns
learned from past audits.
Workflow Management & Collaboration:
Assign remediation tasks, delegate responsibilities, and set deadlines for resolving compliance issues.
Notification systems to alert responsible parties of upcoming audits, overdue tasks, or policy updates.
Security & Compliance:
Robust user authentication, role-based access controls, and audit trails for all user activities.
Compliance with data protection standards (e.g., GDPR), ensuring confidentiality and integrity of sensitive audit
and financial data.

Student Learning Goals: Students participating in the AuditWise AI project will gain hands-on experience in:
Backend and Data Modeling:
Designing data schemas for rules, audit logs, and compliance records.
Building APIs to handle dynamic updates of audit guidelines and track company adherence.
Frontend & UX Design:
Creating intuitive interfaces for policy creation, maintenance, and interpretation.
Data visualization of compliance health, trend charts, and anomaly flags.
AI and NLP Integration:
Implementing NLP techniques to summarize complex textual guidelines into key action points.
Applying ML algorithms for anomaly detection in operational or financial data to preemptively identify compliance
risks.
Leveraging language models to provide guided remediation suggestions and Q&A support for users.
Security, Governance, & Compliance:
Understanding data encryption, secure authentication mechanisms, and logging for auditability.
Gaining insights into industry-standard frameworks (e.g., COSO, ISO standards) to understand the importance of
governance and compliance in corporate environments.
Integration with External Partners:
Designing APIs for secure data exchange with external audit firms.
Learning to handle versioning and synchronization of guidelines from third-party providers.
DevOps and Deployment:
Employing CI/CD pipelines for continuous delivery.
Using containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) to ensure scalability and reliability.

Deliverables: Core Backend System & APIs:
A Python-based backend (Django or FastAPI) to store audit rules, track compliance data, and provide RESTful
endpoints for frontend and external integrations.
Secure endpoints for integrating guidelines from external audit firms.
Frontend Dashboard & User Interface:
An intuitive web UI built with React or Vue.js that allows administrators and auditors to manage policies, run
compliance checks, and view reports.
Visual dashboards showing rule compliance status, trend analyses, and highlighted anomalies.
AI/NLP Components:
NLP pipelines (e.g., using Transformers or spaCy) to summarize large documents of audit guidelines into actionable
bullet points.
Machine learning models for anomaly detection in compliance logs and operational data, identifying potential risk
areas.
A Q&A or guidance assistant using a language model to suggest remediation steps and answer internal
audit-related queries.
Integration & Partner Collaboration Tools:
APIs to periodically fetch and apply updated rules from partnered audit firms.
Documentation for how partners can submit rule updates, best practices, and guidelines.
Security & Access Controls:
Role-based access control, ensuring only authorized personnel can modify or view sensitive rules.
Comprehensive logging and audit trails showing which user made changes and when, ensuring full traceability.
Documentation & User Guides:
Technical documentation (API specs, architectural diagrams, ML model details).
User manuals explaining how to create, update, and assess compliance rules.
Admin guides on how to incorporate external guidelines and interpret anomaly detection results.
Testing & QA Reports:
Test suites covering unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests.
Security assessments and vulnerability scans.
Performance and load testing results ensuring system reliability and scalability.

Desired Backround: Backend & Data Engineering:
Proficiency in Python and frameworks like Django or FastAPI.
Familiarity with relational databases (PostgreSQL) and schema design.
Frontend Development:
Experience with modern JavaScript frameworks (React or Vue.js).
Understanding of data visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js).
AI & ML Engineers:
Knowledge of NLP techniques for text summarization and Q&A (transformer-based models).
Experience with anomaly detection in time-series or categorical data using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
Security & Governance:
Awareness of secure coding practices, encryption, and user authentication/authorization methodologies.
Basic understanding of corporate compliance frameworks and governance models.
DevOps & Deployment:
Familiarity with Docker, CI/CD, and possibly Kubernetes for smooth deployments and scaling.
